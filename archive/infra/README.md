# Sunbird RC, one-click deployment on AWS

https://docs.sunbirdrc.dev/learn/readme

## Description
Sunbird RC is an interoperable and unified registry infrastructure needs to be built to enable "live", "reusable", and “trustworthy” registries as a “single source of truth” to address the above three core issues.

This packaging initiative presents a practical approach to increase the adoption of Sunbird building blocks on AWS by leveraging the reference architecture and one-click deployment automation. Builders can now bypass the need for manual steps when working with the building block within scope and can seamlessly start on AWS.
